how to run lipstick
===================

1. Build the project.
   This involves a library, and a qml plugin.
   They should compile without errors/warnings.

2. Place the library .so file under /usr/lib
   
   NOTE: 64 bit variants of some distributions use /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib

2. Place the plugin .so file and the qmldir file under /usr/lib/qt4/imports/org/nemomobile/lipstick
   
   NOTE: The warning about /usr/lib64 applies here too

3. Get yourself a desktop
   If you haven't got anything better to use, grab the example
   (http://github.com/nemomobile/lipstick-example-home/).

   Build according to instructions, and run it.

   Desktops use both the plugin and shared library generally, so 
   both of them should be intact before you can run the example
   
   NOTE: if you use a properly packaged version of the library,
   you won't need to go through this trouble
